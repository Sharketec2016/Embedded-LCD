Here I want to program the LCD screen to display my name. 

Later we can try and re-implement the countdown timer for finnley's feed.

LCD Screen:
	This communicates through I2C, so we need to relearn that protocol. 
	
I2C:
	For i2c to work you need at least 4 pins. 
		1. VDD - This is your reference high voltage
		2. GD - this is your reference ground
		3. SDA - Signal Data line
		4. SCL - Signal Clock Line. This is to keep the timing proper on the screen.
